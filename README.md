A replica of messenger app Slack on MERN stack.Slack is a messaging app for teams. It brings all your team’s communication and files in one place, where they’re instantly searchable and available wherever you go. Slack has a concept of teams, and each team can have any number of channels. Members of the team can join channels, and the channels are where chats take place.
